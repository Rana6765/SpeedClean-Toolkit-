# SpeedClean-Toolkit-
This plugin solve your web speed optimizetion. 
WordPress plugin called “SpeedClean Toolkit” that combines five performance and cleanup features: Old Post Cleaner, Media Optimizer, Simple Cache Clear Button, Emoji Remover, and Heartbeat Control. The plugin is designed for non-coders, with a centralized settings page to configure all features and clear instructions for setup. It’s lightweight, secure, and uses best practices to optimize WordPress performance. Each feature can be enabled/disabled independently to minimize resource usage.

Since you’ve previously requested individual plugins for Simple Cache Clear Button, Emoji Remover, and Heartbeat Control, I’ll reuse and adapt their core functionality (with the same artifact IDs where applicable) to ensure consistency, while integrating them into this unified toolkit. The Old Post Cleaner and Media Optimizer are new additions, with the latter using the TinyPNG API for image compression.
